# scwin2
User-level driver for steam controllers built in .NET.&ensp;Allows for functionality to be defined using key-mappings written in JSON and inputted using a command line interface.

This is a hobby project that aims to suppliment Steam Input by implementing features in a more simple and na√Øve way to allow for more flexibility when configuring the steam controller.&ensp;For example when a button assigned as a mouse scroll can be set to click the scroll wheel or scroll it while held, and touches and clicks of the trackpads can be configured seperately.

### Dependencies
- .NET 5
- ViGEm Bus Driver: Will run without this but will fail if gamepad inputs are included in the keymap


## How To Use
It is recommended to use this alongside the Steam client and Steam Input.&ensp;The first argument should be the name of a keymap.&ensp;If the given keymap cannot be found then it creates a blank keymap of the given name.&ensp;Flags can appear anywhere.
### Flags
- -n: start the program without creating a virtual gamepad


## Creating Keymaps
The JSON file defines an *Map* (keymap) object:
- Field *Name* specifies the inputmap's name.&ensp;This is optional
- Field *ActionMaps* contains Maps to be applied, similar to Steam Input's action sets.&ensp;Each Map *must* contain a name
- Field *InputMap* defines the keymap.&ensp;Each field is some input on the controller and each input contains fields to define how that input is given:
  - *Regular* is a straight binding of a simulated input to the specified input
  - *TemporalThreshold* defines the timing for when a short press becomes a long press.&ensp;Note: temporal pressingsOnly applies to buttons
  - *ShortPress* simulates input when the duration of the press is below the threshhold
  - *LongPress* simulates input when the duration of the press is above the threshold
  - *IsLongPressHeld* simulates the input of a *LongPress* exactly when the temporal threshold is passed if set to true.&ensp;When false input is decided when the button is released

Each simulated input must include the *$type* field.&ensp;All other fields are optional and will be given a default value if omitted.&ensp;The value shown to the right of the field is its default value.

### Button
Any type beginning with the name "Button" is a type of a button type.&ensp;Any button type can be assigned to a field with "Button" listed as its default value and any such field will default to a button which simulates no input.&ensp;Any button can simulate a press, release, and tap (press and then release).

### ButtonAction
```
"$type": "Backend.ButtonAction, scwin",
"IsLayered": true,
"Name": ""
```
Functions like action layers in Steam Input.&ensp;Layers an action map when it is pressed and removes it when released.&ensp;*Name* specifies the action map to choose.&ensp;*IsLayered* sets transparency; when true if an input in the layer is unbound the program will then try to use the equivalent input from the layer below.$ensp;When false an input with no simulated input bound to it will do nothing.&ensp;It is recommended to keep this true.

### ButtonDoubler
```
"$type": "Backend.ButtonDoubler, scwin",
"Button": Button
```
Taps *Button* when pressed and taps it again when released.

### ButtonDualStage
```
"$type": "Backend.ButtonDualStage, scwin",
"Button": Button,
```
Presses *Button* when pressed and released and then released *Button* when pressed and released again.

### ButtonKey
```

```
Simulates input from a button or key.&ensp;*Key* is the button or key to simulate.

### ButtonScroll
```
"$type": "Backend.ButtonScroll, scwin",
"Amount": 1.0,
"AsClicks": true,
"IsContinuous": false
```
Scrolls the mouse wheel when pressed.&ensp;*Amount* specifies the amount to scroll.&ensp;*AsClicks* specifies whether or not *Amount* represents clicks of the mouse wheel.&ensp;*IsContinuous*, when set to false, will simulate input once for every press of the button.&ensp;When set to true holding the button will continuously scroll the mouse wheel; while held input is sent 100 times per second.

### ButtonMany
```
"$type": "Backend.ButtonMany, scwin",
"Buttons": []

```
Works the same as *StickButtonCross*.&ensp;*OverlapIgnoranceRadius* specifies a distance, measured as a proportion of the trackpad's radius from its center to its edge, within which to not simulate diagonal input.&ensp;Its purpose is to hopefully make swiping feel more precise.

"RelativeSize": 0.5,
"Deadzone": 0.1,

### PadStick
```
"$type": "Backend.PadStick, scwin",
"Deadzone": 0.2,
"OuterLimit": 0.8,

"MinimumSpeed": 80
```
Translates lines drawn as swipes on a trackpad into button input based on the direction of the line.&ensp;For example, with a list of two buttons and an offset of 0.5 pi's a northward swipe would tap the first button and a southward swipe would tap the second.&ensp;*MinimumDistance* sets the minimum length a detected swipe needs to be to activate a button.&ensp;It is recommended to keep this above the default value.&ensp;*AngleOffset* specifies at what angle slice listing begins.&ensp;Measured in amounts of pi (1 would be read as 1*pi).&ensp;*LongSwipeThreshold* set the minimum length a swipe needs to be to be considered a long swipe.&ensp;Measured as a proportion of the diameter of the trackpad.&ensp;This should be greater than *MinimumDistance*; when less all swipes will be considered long swipes.&ensp;The default value is impossible so that long swipes are ignored in default function.&ensp;*Buttons* specifies a list of Button types to be tapped by swiping.&ensp;The size of this sets the amount of directions to draw lines with, extending from 0 pi to 2 pi.&ensp;*LongSwipeButtons* specifies a list of Button types to be pressed by long swipes.&ensp;Since the amount of directions is set by *Buttons* if this list is shorter than *Buttons* the unfilled directions will do nothing.&ensp;*IsContinuous* sets whether multiple swipes can be made from a single gesture.&ensp;By default the end of the swipe is where input stops on the trackpad.&ensp;When enabled this takes where a stroke stops moving to be a swipe's end with *MinimumSpeed* sets how slow the stroke needs to move to be considered stopped.&ensp;*MinimumSpeed* should be kept near the default value for best performance.

### TriggerTrigger
```
"$type": "Backend.TriggerTrigger, scwin",
"IsLeftElseRight": false,
